SubCarrierMap/Demap

InBufSz[2]:  define the input buffer size which is a InBufSz[0]-by-InBufSz[1] matrix
OutBufSz[2]: define the output buffer size which is a OutBufSz[0]-by-OutBufSz[1] matrix

SubCarrierMapping(FIFO<complex<float> > *pInpBuf,FIFO<complex<float> > *pOutBuf)
Map data symbol to sub-carriers (with given pattern=> in this code, allocate data to subcarriers continuously starting from SCLoc)
Insert pilot symbol into subframe (The pilot signal accupy middle OFDM symbol every slot: two slots= one subframe)

SubCarrierDemapping(FIFO<complex<float> > *pInpBuf, FIFO<complex<float> > *pOutBuf);
Extract data symbol and pilot symbol from subframe
