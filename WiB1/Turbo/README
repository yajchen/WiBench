TurboEncoder/Decoder

InBufSz[2]:  define the input buffer size which is a InBufSz[0]-by-InBufSz[1] matrix
OutBufSz[2]: define the output buffer size which is a OutBufSz[0]-by-OutBufSz[1] matrix

Rate:= 1/3 Turbo Code
FSM : define this Turbo Code is in "rsc.txt"
iterations:= iteration number of SISO(Soft Input Soft Output) algorithms
ST10:forward starting state for first SISO   ST1K: forward ending state for first SISO
ST20:backward starting state for second SISO  ST2K: backward ending state for second SISO  
(Since we always start at 0 state in Encoder and we have tail bits which enforce the last state into 0: All of above parameters are set to 0)


TurboEncoding(FIFO<int> *pInpBuf, FIFO<int> *pOutBuf)
Taking information bit stream and generate Rate's output stream: the 1st stream is systematic bits and the others are parity check bits


TurboDecoding(FIFO<float> *pInpBuf, FIFO<int> *pOutBuf)
Taking soft information for each code (in WiBench, it's LLR) and applying iterative SISO algorithm
