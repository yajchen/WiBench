Equalizer

InBufSz[2]:  define the input buffer size which is a InBufSz[0]-by-InBufSz[1] matrix
OutBufSz[2]: define the output buffer size which is a OutBufSz[0]-by-OutBufSz[1] matrix

Estimate channel state information by the received pilot signal(the pilot signal is known to Equalizer)
Equalize the received data using channel state information(either from above estimation or from input perfect channel state information)

1. Equalizing(FIFO<complex<float> > *pInpBuf,FIFO<complex<float> > *pOutBuf)

   Perform frequency domain least square channel estimator
   Perform frequency domain least square equalizer(NOTE: this method takes least computation but it kills channel diversity gain)

2. Equalizing(FIFO<complex<float> > *pInpBuf,FIFO<complex<float> > *pOutBuf, complex<float> ***pPCSI, float AWGNNo)

   Taking perfect channel state information and AWGNNo (does not need to channel estimator)
   Perform minimum mean square error estimator(NOTE: this method keeps channel diversity gain when it has comparative accurate channel state information and it takes more computation)

3. GetpEqW() 

   Return the Equlizer matrix which might be used as aided information for demodulation

4. GetpHdm() (for SCFDMA system)
 
   Return the Channel weight on each subcarrier which might be used as aided information for demodulation
